            After finalizing team members, the remainder of the week was spent discussing problems to tackle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Problem 1: Smart Window/Blind System. <br>
            &#8226; Problem Statement: Energy consumption for heating, cooling, and lighting in buildings contributes significantly to operational costs and carbon emissions. 
            Windows, in particular, play a large role in energy loss, with traditional designs providing little control over light and heat entry. <br>
            &#8226; Need: There is a need for a smart window system that can dynamically adjust its transparency based on external weather conditions and indoor temperature, 
            reducing energy consumption for heating, cooling, and lighting while maintaining occupant comfort - i.e elderly, special needs etc
        </p>
        <p>
            Problem 2: Bike Safety <br> 
            &#8226; Problem Statement: Bicycle riders, especially in urban areas, are at high risk of accidents due to limited visibility, 
            distractions, and poor communication with drivers and pedestrians. <br> 
            &#8226; Need: There is a need for a product that enhances rider safety. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Problem 3: Autonomous Trash Collection Robot for Public Spaces <br>
            &#8226; Problem Statement: Public spaces such as parks and streets often accumulate litter, which can be costly and time-consuming to clean manually. <br>
            &#8226; Need: There is a need for an autonomous robot that can navigate public spaces, identify trash, and collect it, 
            reducing the need for manual labor and keeping environments clean.
