            Once the logic was set up to read the data, the sensor mount needed to be redesigned to accomodate the shape of
            the circuit + battery source. This was designed and the seat post holster was designed, then 3-D printed. After
            printing all these parts, it was then installed on the bike and tested on different types of terrain to ensure
            durability. Tried creating a UI but the Arduino UNO Wifi Rev 2 has such little flash memory. Had to switch to an R4.
