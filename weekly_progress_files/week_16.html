            There was a confusion about bluetooth transmission between the T.O.F sensor and the arduino. The design was originally conceptualized such that there 
            was only one Hm-10 module used and it would be apart of the circuit which houses the T.O.F sensor.  There were then concerns that in order for the T.O.F
            to connect to the arduino wirelessly there would need to be an HM-10 connected to both. A solution was found where the bluetooth scan template in the 
            arduinoBLE library that could scan for bluetooth signals in its vicinity. This constantly scans and outputs the addresses + RSSI values of the devices in
            its vicininty. This test was run and all the values were stored in an excel file. The most frequent values were determined and tested to verify what the 
            unique address of the HM-10 being used was for later configuration.
