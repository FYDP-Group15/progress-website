            The UI for the screen which will serve as the blindspot warning was created and tested. Time was spent understanding the pinout of the T.O.F
            sensor to understand how to configure via I2C/UART and which way would be best/easiest. We went with I2C as there is no need for a resistor
            with this method. The sensor was tested to see if it was outputting accurate information and how quickly.
