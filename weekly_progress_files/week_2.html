            The three proposed problems were ranked to determine what topic the group as a whole would prefer to tackle. The group chose to tackle bike safety.
            A more refined problem definition along with problem criteria and constraints were determined.
        </p>
        <p>
            Need: Bike fatalities and injury rates have remained stagnant. Market for bikes (ebikes more so but works for now) is growing. 
            Minimal effective safety products to help lower these rates.

            Problem Definition: Lowering the rate of fatalities
        </p>
        <p>
            Criteria:
            &#8226; Providing bike safety information (collision detection, blindspot, etc)
            &#8226; Doesn't limit F.O.V
            &#8226; Doesn't distract rider
            &#8226; Minimize weight
            &#8226; Minimize price
            &#8226; Aesthetically pleasing product
        </p>
        <p>
            Constraints:
            &#8226; Material cost below $300
            &#8226; More constraints to be determined once optimal solution is decidede upon
